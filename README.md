# Workflow_Tutorials
This is a repository meant to give some basic tips for students on this project to be set up a clean workflow for code (including things like git and virtual environments) 

For installing git, first-time setup, and creating a git repository, see: https://git-scm.com/video/get-going

# Cloning a repository
Go to a directory in which you wish the repo to be cloned over, then run:
git clone https://github.com/dolphin-acoustics-vip/science-communication

Create a new branch called "new_branch"
git branch "new_branch"

We can check that the new branch is created by running:
git branch

We should see a "main" branch (which you should be in) and the new "new_branch"

Move over to the new_branch
git checkout new_branch

We can now make changes in new_branch which do not affect the main branch
Make a change to example_code.py

Now we add those changes to what is called the "staging environment"
Run either


Next, we 
git commit
